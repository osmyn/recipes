===========

### Instructions

1. Cook full package of bacon. Suggest cooking on medium-hot grill in cast iron skillet. Drain twice being careful not to splatter yourself by pouring away from yourself. Set aside.
2. While bacon cooks, melt 1/4 stick of butter and brush on buns (spray with butter spray if needed). After bacon is done, toast the buns on the grill and set aside.
3. Cut sirloin steak and remaining butter into bite-sized pieces and place on cookie sheet and put into the freezer for 20 mins until the steak is firm but pliable.
4. Make a recipe of bacon mayo.
5. Chop the cilantro into 1/2 inch pieces and place in a bowl.
6. Shred the gouda and place in a bowl.
7. With a food processor, pulse the stiffened sirloin and butter for 5 second pulses until the meat is rice-grained sized; about 5 times.
8. Spread sirloin out on cookie sheet and season with salt and pepper, siracha, crumbled crackers, and apple sauce. Toss gently and divide into five equal portions.
9. From each portion make two burger patties and place on a cookie sheet coated with non-stick spray. Put a small depression in the center of the burger so that it cooks up flat.
10. Freeze the burger patties for 30 minutes.
11. Fifteen minutes before grilling, heat grill to high, scrape, and wipe down with a mixture of 1/2 C water and 2 T vegetable oil using a paper towel and tongs.
12. Grill burgers about 4 minutes and flip once. Distribute bacon and gouda on top. Grill another 4 or 5 minutes until done.
13. Put a generous amount of bacon marmalade on bottom buns and distribute cilantro on top of that, then place cooked burger on bottom bun.
14. Put a generous amount of bacon mayo on top bun and serve.
