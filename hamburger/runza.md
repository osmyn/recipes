|2 C Sauerkraut, squeezed dry|
|1 1/2 t Salt|
|1/2 t Pepper|

### Instructions
Dissolve yeast in warm water, then add the remaining ingredients; adding flour until dough is manageable, but not too stiff. 
Refrigerate dough in covered bowl for a few hours.

Cut dough between the piles and wrap each mound of filling into an oblong-shaped bun.
