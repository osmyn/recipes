# Sweet and Spicy Jerky

This recipe is an adaptation of Chef John's recipe: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/241555/homemade-beef-jerky/

### Ingredients:
- 3/4 cup Worcestershire Sauce
- 3/4 cup Soy Sauce
- 1 Tablespoon of smoke paprika
- 1 Tablespoon of honey (it's not about precision here)
- 1/2 Tablespoon of freshly ground black pepper
- 1 Tablespoon of red pepper flakes
- 2 teaspoons of garlic powder
- 5 pounds of beef top round, about 1/4 in thickness

### Directions
1. Whisk Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, paprika, honey (I heat the honey in the microwave for 10-15 seconds to ensure it will more easily whisk into the mix), black pepper, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, and onion powder together in a bowl. Add beef to bowl and turn to coat beef completely. Marinate in the refrigerator overnight. (I like to use a hand-pumped vacuum sealed tupperware to help speed up the marinade)
2. Take the meat out of the marinade and pat the meat on the marinade vessel to shake some of the excess marinade off the meat. Place the meat in your dehydrator, leaving space around the meat to ensure good airflow.
3. Dehydrate the meat at 160 degrees F for 7 hours

NOTE: If you feel your meat is over dehyradated use a spray bottle of water to help slightly rehydrate the meat

Personal note: I found this quite good but I could use more spice. I want to try this recipe with ghost pepper flakes instead of red pepper
