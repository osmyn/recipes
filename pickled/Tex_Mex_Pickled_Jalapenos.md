#Tex Mex Pickled Jalapenos

**NOTE**: I do not create a brine for this. Most home made pickle recipes, for canning, tell you to use a hot brine but this results in a mushy jalapeno so I just reuse pickle juice from store bought pickles

##Ingredients
- 1 Dozen jalapenos
- 1 Bunch of cilantro
- 1/2 clove of garlic
- Pickle brine  _(left over pickle juice from store bought pickles works great!)_
(add your flavors from here on if you'd like. Some good suggestions: habanero's for kick, coriander seed, red pepper flakes, etc...)

##Steps
1. Slice jalapenos to desired thickness. _I usually do 1/4 inch thick. I also use a kitchen mandolin for ease and cut consistancy._
1. Coarsley chop up your cilantro. _Nothing crazy here you just want to avoid trying to put a bouqet of cilantro into a jar._
1. Slice your garlic cloves, or crush.
1. Take a jar, _any canning jar should be fine or reuse your old pickle jar_, and toss in your ingredients then fill the jar with your left over pickle juice.

_NOTE: Pickle juice can usually be reused at least a couple of times so build up on the flavors!_
